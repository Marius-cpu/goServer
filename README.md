# goServer
Creates a server that listens on the port specified in properties/port.txt 
 # Cool stuff:
- You can add your own HTML in html/index.html. Note: file must be called index.html in order for this to work.
- You can add Javascript files, CSS and almost everything!
- While changing the port in the port.txt file, the first line must be the port only!
